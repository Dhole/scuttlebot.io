## Sync via Wifi

**Step 1:** turn on Scuttlebot.<br>
**Step 2:** you're done!

Scuttlebot automatically detects other Scuttlebot peers on the LAN, and downloads their messages.

> If you're having trouble with Wifi sync, check if your computer is configured to allow LAN traffic.
For instance, in OSX, the Security & Privacy Firewall will block Scuttlebot's LAN-discovery.
